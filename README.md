This document describes how to use an Ubuntu 22.04 machine for compiling, flashing, and debugging TM4C123GXL devices using a common IDE used on Linux, Visual Studio Code (VS Code).  VS Code is an alternative to, and a more generalizable solution than, using Texas Instrument's (TIâ€™s) IDE Code Composer Studio (CCS) for software/firmware development on Linux. 

## Software Installation

**Visual Studio Code**
 - Purpose: IDE
 - Version: 1.76.0
 - Source: Repos (snap)
     - `$ sudo apt-get install code`
 - Extensions
    - Cortex-Debug (version 1.8.0)
    - C/C++ (version 1.14.4)
    - Python (version 2022.10.1)
    - Others as neccessary or you see fit

 **GTKTerm**
- Purpose: Connecting/Reconnecting to UART serial interface
- Version: 1.1.1
- Source: Repos
    - `$ sudo apt-get install gtkterm`

**gcc-arm-none-eabi**
- Purpose: Cross complier for ARM Cortex R/M processors
- Version: 10.3.1
- Source: Repos
    - `$ sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-none-eabi`

**lm4flash**
- Purpose: Flashing binary files to device
- Version: 0.1.3
- Source: Repos
    - `$ sudo apt-get install lm4flash`

**OpenOCD**
- Purpose: Allow the debugger (gdb-multiarch) to connect to the on chip debugger
- Version: 0.12.0
- Source: https://sourceforge.net/projects/openocd/
    - The Cortex-Debug extension in vscode expects openocd's config files to be in /usr/local/share/openocd/scripts/; however, version 0.10 and 0.11 both store them in /usr/share/openocd/scripts/ using slightly different names.  Version 0.12.0 does store the scripts in the expected location; therfore, 0.12.0 was installed. 
    - Download and extract the openocd-0.12.0.tar.bz2 from the link above
    - The README indicates to install/verify the installation of the following:
        - make
            - Version used for this guide: 4.3
            - Source: repos
        - libtool
            - Version used for this guide: 2.4.6
            - Source: repos
        - pkg-config
            - Version used for this guide: 0.29.2
            - Source: repos
        - libusb-1.0
            - Version used for this guide: 1.0.25
            - Source: repos
        - `$ sudo apt-get install make libtool pkg-config libusb-1.0`
    - As per the README run the following commands while in the same directory:
        - `./configure`
            - No option flags were needed.
            - You should see something like the following when it is done:
                    ![Config Output](pics/OpenOCD-config-results.png)

        - `make`
        - `sudo make install`


## Configuration

**Symlink to gdb-multiarch**
- Reasoning: the Cortex-Debug extension calls upon arm-none-eabi-gdb (the cross-compiler's debugger); however, arm-none-eabi-gdb is no longer a binary associated with the gcc-arm-none-eabi suite. It appear that 'gdb-muliarch' is now the gdb used for the cross compiler.  Since the Cortex-Debug error only indicated that it doesn't have the correct *path* to the arm-none-eabi-gdb binary, updating the path settings doesn't solve the issue; however, creating a symlink that points Cortex-Debug to gdb-multiarch when it is calling arm-none-eabi-gdb does.  
- While in the /usr/bin/ directory, run:
    - `$ sudo ln -s gdb-multiarch arm-none-eabi-gdb`
    - `$ sudo chmod 755 arm-none-eabi-gdb`
        - Sets the perms of the symlink the same as the other binaries in /usr/bin/.


**Permissions**
- Reasoning: When a usb device (e.g., the TM4C123GXL) is connected, Linux assigns it a name lists it in the /dev/ directory.  Since this is dynamically assigned we can find out what device name the TM4C123GXL was assigned by reviewing recent activity on the system:
    - `dmesg`
        - This should result in something like:
                ![Dmesg Output](pics/dmesg.png)
